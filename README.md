# q-simon

Suite of [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) scripts that allow
simulating Simon's quantum computation algorithm <sup>[1]</sup> in a classical
computer.

Daniel R. Simon created this algorithm to solve a theoretical problem, which
requires exponential time to solve in a traditional computer. The algorithm
uses Quantum mechanics principles to solve it in polynomical time.

This code was created as part of the Excelence Baccalaureate research project.

Details on the usage of this code can be found in the project's
[wiki](https://github.com/YagoGG/q-simon/wiki).
